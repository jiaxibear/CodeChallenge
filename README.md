<b> - Sprint Goals:</b>

Based on the features implemented in the sprint 1, more expected features should be implemented in the sprint 2, including discussion board, sandboxing for the site safety, more language choice and/or problem choices, etc.

Users should be able to view their submission history for each coding problem, and they will be able to choose whether they want to code their problem in Java, Python, or C++. Also, discussion board (forum) and search by keyword will be enabled. Also, oj worker should be separated from the main logic.

Firstly, the estimation of the workload for each task is not accurate because of the lack of experience.

Secondly, the UI should be improved.
